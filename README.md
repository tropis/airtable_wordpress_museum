# Airpress Wordpress Museum

This project shows how to build a demo Museum table in Airpress and display
the table in a Wordpress page.

The Airtable base has sample Museum data and public domain photos.  
A Wordpress page is built with plugins to pull the Museum data, and display
various data and photos in an interactive page template.
